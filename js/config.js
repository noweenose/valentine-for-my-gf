  message: `Hi Charlotte,
Nine months with you feels less like counting time and more like getting used to a kind of happiness I don’t want to lose. Being with you feels calm and warm in a way that makes ordinary days better just by having you in them.
Thank you for being patient with me, for choosing us, and for loving me in all the quiet ways that matter most. 
I may not always have the right words or the grand gestures, but I hope you always feel how deeply I care for you and how grateful I am to walk through life with you, one month at a time.`,
