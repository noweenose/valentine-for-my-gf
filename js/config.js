  message: `Hi my love,
  ten months na tayo and it feels less like counting time and more like getting used to a kind of happiness I don't want to lose. 
  Being with you feels calm and warm in a way that makes ordinary days better just by having you in them.
  Thank you for being patient with me, for choosing me, and for loving me in all the ways that matter most. 
  I may not always have the right words or the grand gestures, but I hope you always feel how deeply I care for you and how grateful I am to walk through life with you, every single day.
  I am looking forward to all the memories we have yet to make together, and the achievements we'll celebrate side by side.
  I love you so much baby, I hope that we continue to grow together and support each other in everything we do. I can't wait to see what the future holds for us.
  Here's to us, our dreams, and to many more months and years ahead. Happy 10th monthsary, my love.
  With all my heart,
  Nowee`,
